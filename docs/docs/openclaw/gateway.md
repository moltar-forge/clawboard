# OpenClaw Gateway

The OpenClaw gateway is the runtime control service. It provides HTTP and WebSocket endpoints for
querying live agent sessions, retrieving usage data, and invoking tools. Clawboard API connects to
the gateway to power the Agent Monitor and standup features.

## What the gateway enables in Clawboard

- **Agent Monitor**: live session status, costs, and token usage per agent
- **Session history**: view conversation history and session details
- **Standups**: AI-generated daily summaries of agent activity
- **Real-time status**: whether agents are active, idle, or offline

## Gateway configuration in `openclaw.json`

The gateway is configured under the `gateway` section of `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "port": 18789,
    "mode": "local",
    "bind": "lan",
    "controlUi": {
      "allowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:18789", "https://your-domain.example.com"]
    },
    "auth": {
      "mode": "token"
    },
    "tls": {
      "enabled": true,
      "autoGenerate": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Key settings

| Setting                    | Description                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `port`                     | Port the gateway listens on (default: `18789`) |
| `mode`                     | `local` for local/LAN use                      |
| `bind`                     | `lan` to bind to all LAN interfaces            |
| `auth.mode`                | `token` for bearer token authentication        |
| `tls.enabled`              | Enable TLS (recommended)                       |
| `tls.autoGenerate`         | Auto-generate a self-signed certificate        |
| `controlUi.allowedOrigins` | Allowed CORS origins for the gateway UI        |

## Connecting Clawboard API to the gateway

Add these variables to `.env`:

```bash
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:18789
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your-gateway-token
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT_MS=15000
```

:::note TLS and self-signed certificates If the gateway uses TLS with a self-signed certificate, you
may need to configure Node.js to accept it. In development, you can set
`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` in your `.env` (never in production). For production, use a
properly signed certificate or a reverse proxy that handles TLS termination. :::

## Device pairing workflow

Clawboard now requires device-authenticated gateway access for runtime RPCs. The gateway token
remains part of the bootstrap handshake, but owner/admin users must complete a one-time pairing flow
in the dashboard before session data and runtime control become available.

### Pairing steps

1. Configure `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` and `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
2. Restart Clawboard API
3. Sign in as an `owner` or `admin`
4. Open `Settings -> OpenClaw Pairing`
5. Click `Start pairing`
6. Approve the pending Clawboard device in OpenClaw
7. Click `Finalize pairing`

Clawboard persists the paired device identity after the workflow completes.

## Verifying gateway connectivity

```bash
# Basic health check
curl http://localhost:18789/health

# Via Clawboard API (requires Clawboard JWT)
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"your-password"}' \
  | jq -r '.token')

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/openclaw/sessions
```

## Troubleshooting

**Agent Monitor shows no data** The gateway is not connected or pairing is incomplete. Check:

- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` is set and correct
- The gateway is running and accessible
- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is correct
- The Clawboard device has been approved and pairing is `ready`

**Pairing wizard cannot connect** Check:

- `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` includes the gateway origin Clawboard is using
- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` matches the actual gateway scheme and host
- The gateway token is valid

**Connection timeout** The gateway is unreachable or slow. Increase `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT_MS` or
check network connectivity.

**TLS errors** If using TLS with a self-signed cert in development, set
`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` in `.env`. For production, use a properly signed certificate.
