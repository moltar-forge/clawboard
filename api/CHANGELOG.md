# Changelog

All notable changes to Clawboard API will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Persistent OpenClaw gateway RPC mode (`gatewayWsRpc`) with reusable WebSocket channel, auth-aware reconnect logic, and bounded in-flight request control
- New persistent RPC regression tests (`openclawGatewayClient.persistent.test.js`) covering socket reuse, auth-fingerprint reconnect, and explicit short-lived rollback override
- Committed `docker-compose.override.yml` for local development convenience (auto-loaded by docker compose)
- Development override swaps production nginx dashboard for Vite dev server with HMR and bind-mounted source
- OpenClaw split-root support, including native `~/.openclaw` remaps and config-root/workspace separation
- Comprehensive test suite covering config, app entry point, database migrations, jobs (archiveDoneTasks, runDailyStandup), routes (activity, auth, models, openclaw, standups, tasks, users, admin/users agent-config), services (activityLogService, modelPricingService, openclawGatewayClient, openclawWorkspaceClient, sessionUsageService, standupService, subagentsRuntimeService), and utilities (configParser, jwt, logger)
- `.claude/` project rules and configuration (CLAUDE.md + rules for architecture, contributing, openclaw, security, testing)
- Internal docs-link reconciliation service for OpenClaw workspaces (`docs` links), plus workspace client helpers for `/links/:type/:agentId`
- Startup + agent create/update lifecycle hooks that reconcile docs links only when missing (`GET` state first, `PUT` only on `missing`)

### Changed

- OpenClaw gateway RPC defaults now prefer persistent mode at runtime, with tri-state override support via `OPENCLAW_WS_PERSISTENT_RPC` (`true`/`false`/unset)
- OpenClaw WebSocket TLS validation now defaults to secure verification; self-signed/internal certs require explicit `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_INSECURE_TLS=true`
- Added persistent RPC tuning controls: `OPENCLAW_WS_RPC_IDLE_MS` and `OPENCLAW_WS_RPC_MAX_INFLIGHT`
- Simplified org chart generation to derive from `agents.list` and removed corporate defaults
- Renamed org chart references to agents
- Improved CORS configuration to handle requests with no origin (mobile apps, curl requests)
- Updated Helmet security middleware configuration with crossOriginResourcePolicy
- Reordered middleware (CORS before Helmet) to avoid configuration conflicts
- Normalized main OpenClaw workspace paths to `/workspace` and removed legacy aliasing
- OpenClaw remap defaults are now additive with longest-prefix matching
- CI workflow updated to include test execution step
- Jest config updated to support full test suite
- Various route and service refinements to support test coverage (activity, openclaw, admin/users, tasks, users)
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude additional generated files
- Documentation references updated for OpenClaw path changes
- API startup now performs non-fatal docs-link reconciliation for `main` and configured agents from `openclaw.json`
- Agent configuration create/update flows now trigger non-fatal docs-link reconciliation for affected agents
- Docs-link reconciliation remains internal-only in this phase (no public Clawboard API link-management endpoint; dashboard does not trigger writes)

### Fixed

- Reduced OpenClaw gateway WebSocket churn by replacing per-RPC socket open/close patterns with persistent channel reuse
- Normalized persistent RPC error contracts to existing gateway semantics (`SERVICE_TIMEOUT` / `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` with `503`) while preserving internal persistent error codes
- Disabled OpenClaw workspace client when the workspace URL is unset
- Gateway auth fallback now uses the backend client identity
- OpenClaw remap handling now remaps absolute paths before workspace allowlist checks
- OpenClaw fallback agents now allow legacy archived paths

### Security

- Switched Gitleaks license key to an organization secret

- Updated API documentation to reflect new workspace path structure
